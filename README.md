# Grind_75

Grind 75 is a customized leetcode study plan which is provided by the [tech interview handbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75). The handbook comprises of 75 common leetcode challenges where you are able to customize how you would like to approach them based on the amount of time you are able to put on a weekly basis. On my end, The challenges are broken down into three main types, 

    - Easy
    - Medium
    - Hard
 
The idea behind this is to build some brain muscle memory and confidence by first solving the easy ones then you progressing to the medium ones then finally solving the hard ones. The challenges will be solved by both JavaScript and Ruby programming languages.


Enjoy!

## Built With
